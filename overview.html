<h1>Neural machine translation</h1>
<p>You have been recently employed in the tech team of a mass-media conglomerate that publishes news andmagazines in Hindi.  The company now wants to expand its operations and wants to publish its articlesand editorials in other languages including English.  The CEO of the company came to know about thewonders of deep learning and he wants to deploy these technologies in the company.  Since you are partof the tech team and more importantly you have done CS779 course at IITK, the company wants youto develop a neural machine translation system that could automatically translate the articles/editorialswritten in Hindi to English.From the course, you remember different types of neural models, e.g., RNN based models, sequence-to-sequence models, transformer models.  You plan to use these to implement a MT system for translationfrom Hindi to English.This assignment requires you to implement Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to translate fromHindi to English.  One of the prominent model architectures used in NMT is encoder-decoder architecture.It consists of two components an encoder that takes as input the source language sentence (e.g., Hindi)and learns a representation for it, this representation is then fed to the decoder that then decodes (i.e.,predict) the target language sentence (e.g, English) word by word.  There is flexibility with regard to theneural architecture of the encoder and the decoder.In this assignment you have the freedom to choose any neural architecture for the encoder and the decoder.Similarly, for decoding the target language sentence, you have the freedom to choose any strategy, e.g.,greedy, beam search, etc.</p>
